<!-- Adding hidden thumb because Blogger does weird cropping --> <img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6PgVrgplO3c/U-68yf9aPEI/AAAAAAADqgM/GGKJzphT5tM/s1600/robot_tennisThumbRatio.png" width="72" height="72" style="display:none;" />  <div style="margin-top: 0px;">Do you think robots like tennis? My guess is that when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBAYIK8CdPc" target="_blank">Robot Apocalypse</a> starts, you'll see them playing all the time. So, for the human race to survive, it will be critical for us to learn as much as we can from the large amount of data generated at the <a href="http://www.wimbledon.com/index.html" target="_blank">Wimbledon tennis championships</a> and <a href="http://wimbledoninsights.com/ibm-wimbledon/" target="_blank">collected by IBM</a>.<br /><br /></div><div style="margin-top: 0px;">With that in mind, I encourage you to take part in the <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/wimbledon_innovation_challenge/index.html" target="_blank">Wimbledon Innovation Challenge</a>. You'll have access to <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/wimbledon_innovation_challenge/data/Wimbledon_2013_Sample_Point_by_Point_data.csv">tennis data</a> and be asked to use <a href="https://www.bluemix.net/" target="_blank">IBM Bluemix</a> to build an app that consumes and analyzes this data in useful, innovative ways. You'll compete against others for either Best Mobile App or Best Data Insights. <br /><br /></div>Time is of the essence, so luckily Bluemix facilitates rapid development of apps in the cloud. Just this week, Bluemix left beta and became <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/2014/06/30/general-availability/" target="_blank">generally available</a>. The <a href="https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/store/cloudOEPaneId=store" target="_blank">Bluemix Catalog</a> contains more than 50 services in such wide ranging categories as Web, Mobile, Internet of Things, Big Data, Analytics, Security, and Dev Ops. So, there's no shortage of tools you can use as building blocks to do some cool and amazing things&nbsp;in your apps.<br /><br />Now, maybe my fears of tennis-playing robots are paranoid and irrational. But, it's better to be safe than sorry. So, please do your part and start building your apps!<br /><br /><b>NOTE:</b> Entry deadline is October 24, 2014.<br /><a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/wimbledon_innovation_challenge/index.html" target="_blank"><img alt="Bluemix, Robots, and the Wimbledon Innovation Challenge" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-4Ta1wvVze04/VDl4RsrZKgI/AAAAAAADxHE/AhrhZGAD6lM/s1600/robots_tennis.png" style="display: block; height: auto; margin: 20px auto; max-height: 388px; max-width: 872px; position: relative; text-align: center; width: 100%;padding: 0px;" /></a><br /><em>Special thanks to IBM colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/angelajbates" target="_blank">Angela Bates</a> for the background info on the <a href="http://www-05.ibm.com/uk/wimbledon_innovation_challenge/index.html" target="_blank">Wimbledon Innovation Challenge</a>.</em>
