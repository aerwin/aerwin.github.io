Where am I? Where can I go? Where have I been? In this tutorial, you'll build a client/server app that answers these and other "where" questions for web users and for wearers of the [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/){:target="_blank"} smartwatch.

First, you'll build the back end: a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/){:target="_blank"} app that you'll deploy to [IBMÂ® Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/){:target="_blank"}. The back end provides a REST API that enables clients to:

- Register a user's geolocation with the server, to be stored in a [Cloudant NoSQL database](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south){:target="_blank"}.
- Get the nearest postal address associated with the location by using the Pitney Bowes Reverse Geocoding service (UPDATE: now part of the [APIs from Pitney Bowes](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/apis-from-pitney-bowes?env_id=ibm:yp:us-south){:target="_blank"} service). This service provides a powerful API for looking up postal addresses based on GPS location.
- Retrieve information about where someone could travel from a location,  by using the Pitney Bowes Travel Boundary service. This service provides GPS coordinates for a "boundary" around a specified location that can be reached based on driving time or distance.
- Provide worldwide statistics for recent and popular "check-in" locations (using the [MapReduce](https://cloudant.com/product/cloudant-features/mapreduce/){:target="_blank"} capabilities in Cloudant).

Then, you'll use this REST API as the basis for building two very different client apps:

- A responsive, single-page web app that is implemented by using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/){:target="_blank"}, [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank"}, and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/){:target="_blank"} and provides extensive, rich content.

- An app written for Pebble that's designed to provide useful but more-focused info in the smaller screen of this cool wearable device. You'll write this client app in JavaScript by using the [Pebble.js](http://pebble.github.io/pebblejs/){:target="_blank"} library and the [CloudPebble](https://cloudpebble.net/){:target="_blank"} online IDE.
